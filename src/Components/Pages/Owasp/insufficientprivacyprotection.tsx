            <Text fontSize={"l"}> Personal user information stored on devices or within ecosystems being used insecurely, improperly or without the userâ€™s permission is a major security risk. The privacy of users is often disregarded despite the recent rise of attention in the news. Secondly, the impact of ignoring privacy rights and regulations is underestimated by companies. However, having the proper safety measures in place is a must. Otherwise, hackers might be able to get access to critical data. On top of that, not only is the information of users at risk, but also the databases of the manufacturers could be prone for an attack. There have been several instances where information was extracted. To tackle this problem the following is advised: limited personal data storage on devices, a solid data protection policy and good preparation in the event of a potential breach of security in the future, for example an incident response plan.
