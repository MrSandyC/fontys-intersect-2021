                The Master Lock 4901EURDLHCC is a biometric security lock that is used for locking something that needs
                to be locked outdoors.
                It uses a biometric fingerprint reader and registered fingerprints to check if somebody is supposed to
                have access to this lock. It can also be unlocked by a preset code and it can store-up to 10
                fingerprints.

                The device makes use of a biometric scanner, while this also has some downsides, generally it serves as
                an additional form of secure authentication. The device also has a reset mechanism, that locks the device, when battery life is depleted.

                The Lock also has a standard password that is not required to be changed and limited requirements to the
                strength of this password. Meaning that if this standard password is known by attackers, they can access
                the
                lock easily.

            <Text fontSize="l">
                force the user to create a password at device setup, set clear and secure password requirements.

                not limited to the following At least 8 combinations with a possibility of more inputs like a number

                Fix:

            <Text fontSize="l">
                use a better design and stronger metals, also implement a cost-effective mechanism to instantly notify
                your customer about device tampering, notification delivery should be instant.

            <Text fontSize="l">
                After inputting the correct code the device will instantly unlock, given that the standard number of
                combinations that people will have to go through to unlock your device is between 256 (4^4) and 4096
                (4^6), if the users code is 6 combinations long just inputting 6 numbers everytime can decrease the
                number of attempts to get in significantly.
                Also let users have limited login attempts within a short amount of time. This will increase the time an
                attacker will have to put in to open the lock with a bruteforce attack.

                Have a confirm button that makes it so that the user has to confirm their code every time.
